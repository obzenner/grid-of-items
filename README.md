### 37
This is a `Webpack + TS + Express + React (with styled-components)` application that renders a list of info cards. It has a Jest test runner and a pre-commit hook that runs unit tests.

## How to run the applocation locally
- Run _yarn_ to install dependencies
- Run _yarn start_ to build and start the application on `localhost:3000`
- Both server and client processes allow hot reload for development

## Features
- **Scaper:** the initial data `json` file, that is stored in `ninjasData` folder, is generated by `yarn get-grid` script. It runs `utils/generate-grid-items.ts` file that uses Puppeteer + Cheerio to scape the data that is later used in the application. The scrapped data is later used for the API: `localhost:3000/api`. The API does not run the scraper and returns the static JSON file instead, since scrapping is a heavy task.
- **React:** the initial render is done on with the Express server app in `/server/index.tsx`(it's a tsx file, since React is also supported on the server side, as seen in the main `/` route handler) where the scrapped data is passed on to the `Ninjas` component that then is hydrated on the client.
- **Sorting && Filtering:** Basic sorting and filtering is implemented and tested in `tests.spec.ts`

## Future
- Add more TS types, unit and load tests
- Address asset size limit warnings and improve the webpack setup
- Improve the UI/UX
- Re-write the `filterNinjas` function to be more performant (at least O(n)) or find a recommended existing solution
- Improve Github actions and CI/CD and figure out deploy strategies for the app
